# German Learning AppThis project is an Android application designed to help users learn German vocabulary and grammar efficiently using a Spaced Repetition System (SRS).

## Aim of the Project
The core goal is to create a clean, intuitive mobile app that leverages cognitive science principles to optimize memory retention. Instead of just showing cards, the app schedules reviews at the perfect time, just before you're likely to forget, making learning faster and more effective.

## Current Status
The app is currently in an early development stage. The UI , navigation, and core business logic (like the SRS algorithm) are in place.
**Note:** The Room database for permanent storage is set up but not yet fully integrated. For demonstration and testing purposes, the app currently runs on a `FakeCardRepository`, which provides a sample set of decks and cards. 
This allows the UI and study flow to be tested without needing a  real database.
